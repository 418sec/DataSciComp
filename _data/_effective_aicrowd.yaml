  note: 'Given the growing importance of the field and the potential societal impact in the medical domain or fair decision making, it is high time to bring disentanglement to the real-world:
  <br>Stage 1: Sim-to-real transfer learning - design representation learning algorithms on simulated data and transfer them to the real world.
  <br>Stage 2: Advancing disentangled representation learning to complicated physical objects.'
