  note: "This challenge proposes to develop machine learning based approaches so as to predict individuals' comfort model using several <b>time series</b> of environmental data obtained from sensors in a large building. The objective is to learn a classifier that uses these time series as inputs to predict the associated comfort class computed as an average of the comfort classes of all individuals in the building, assumed to experience the same environmental conditions."
