To address numerous requests for benchmarking only cell segmentation methods (without tracking), we are launching now a new time-lapse cell segmentation benchmark on the same datasets (plus one new dataset).'

  note: 'Computer assisted tools can provide cost effective and easily deployable solutions for cancer diagnostics. The aim of this challenge is to build a classifier for the identification of leukemic versus normal immature cells for while blood cancer, namely, B-ALL diagnostics. A dataset of cells with class labels, marked by the expert based on the domain knowledge, will be provided at the subject-level to train the classifier. This problem is interesting because the two cell types appear similar under the microscope and subject-level variability plays a key role. Hence, it is challenging to build a classifier that can yield good results on prospective data.'
