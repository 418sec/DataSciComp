  note: 'In 2012, Cell Tracking Challenge (CTC) was launched to objectively compare and evaluate state-of-the-art whole-cell and nucleus segmentation and tracking methods using both real (2D and 3D) time-lapse microscopy videos of cells and nuclei, along with computer generated (2D and 3D) video sequences simulating nuclei moving in realistic environments. To address numerous requests for benchmarking only cell segmentation methods (without tracking), we are launching now a new time-lapse cell segmentation benchmark on the same datasets (plus one new dataset).'

  note: 'Computer assisted tools can provide cost effective and easily deployable solutions for cancer diagnostics. The aim of this challenge is to build a classifier for the identification of leukemic versus normal immature cells for while blood cancer, namely, B-ALL diagnostics. A dataset of cells with class labels, marked by the expert based on the domain knowledge, will be provided at the subject-level to train the classifier. This problem is interesting because the two cell types appear similar under the microscope and subject-level variability plays a key role. Hence, it is challenging to build a classifier that can yield good results on prospective data.'
