  note: '<b>Enhance the vegetation payload performances.</b>
  <br>In this competition you are given multiple images of each of 78 Earth locations and you are asked to develop an algorithm to fuse them together into a single one. The result will be a "super-resolved" image that is checked against a high resolution image taken from the same satellite, PROBA-V. The "V" stands for Vegetation, which is the main focus of the on-board instruments. Can you enhance the vision of PROBA-V and help us advance the accuracy on monitoring earths vegetation growth?'
