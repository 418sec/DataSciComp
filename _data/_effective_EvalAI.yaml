  note: 'Visual Dialog is a novel task that requires an AI agent to hold a meaningful dialog with humans in natural, conversational language about visual content. Specifically, given an image, a dialog history (consisting of the image caption and a sequence of previous questions and answers), the agent has to answer a follow-up question in the dialog. To perform well on this task, the agent needs to ground the query not only in the visual content but also in the dialog history.'
